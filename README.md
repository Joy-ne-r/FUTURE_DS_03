# Student Event Feedback Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes student event feedback to uncover satisfaction trends and suggest improvements.  
It uses survey data (numeric ratings) to generate insights through data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Google Colab** – interactive environment
- **pandas** – data cleaning & manipulation
- **seaborn / matplotlib** – charting & visualization
- **TextBlob / VADER** – sentiment analysis (for text feedback)
- **Google Forms (CSV export)** – survey data source

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Sentiment analysis (numeric mapping + NLP)
- Survey insights & storytelling
- Charting (bar plots, heatmaps, boxplots, stacked bars)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains student feedback with ratings on:
- Subject knowledge
- Concept explanation
- Use of presentations
- Assignment difficulty
- Doubt solving
- Course structuring
- Student support
- Course recommendation

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the survey CSV file (`student_feedback.csv`).
3. Run the analysis cells step by step:
   - Data cleaning
   - Sentiment mapping
   - Visualization (bar charts, heatmaps, boxplots)
   
## 📊 Example Visualizations
- **Bar chart**: Average ratings per question
- **Stacked bar chart**: Positive/Neutral/Negative proportions
- **Heatmap**: Correlation between survey dimensions
- **Boxplot**: Distribution of ratings per question

## Insights & Recommendations
- Strengths: High ratings for subject knowledge and doubt solving.
- Weaknesses: Lower ratings for course structuring and assignment difficulty.
- Suggested improvements:
  - Balance assignment workload
  - Provide clearer course outlines
  - Enhance student support systems
